          <li>supporting local farmers at home and eating Big Macs at the airport.</li>
          <li>not knowing whether to listen to your doctor or a paleo mom blog.</li>
          <li>getting analysis paralysis every time you walk into a grocery store.</li>
          <li>believing for years that avocadoes are a good source of protein.</li>
          <li>discovering that a butcher shop started by vegans actually exists.</li>
          <li>reading stuff that says coffee both gives you and prevents cancer.</li>

        <p class="first">Nomplussed: an email-driven experiment around how to survive eating in the modern world.</p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Every other week, I&rsquo;ll send out a short written piece on one aspect of modern eating that I find challenging, intriguing, or just extra-chewy. I will try to be as objective, honest and entertaining as possible.</p>
        <p>If you think of something to say, hit reply. I&rsquo;ll read everything, then put your responses in an FSC-certified compostable paper sack, shake vigorously, and serve up the results in a second email the following week.</p>
        <p>If you ever get bored, hangry, or just so sick and tired of feeding that damn needy biological body of yours, you can unsubscribe at any time. (Or drink Soylent. No judgment.)</p>
        <p>The first email goes out in July.</p>
        <p>Join me and let&rsquo;s figure out modern eating, together.</p>
